Change is slow and Gradual
Patience and Persistence Calm and Composure win the race
Each second you put into it counts
The more you learn the more you earn
Losers have excuses
Yes, I don't enjoy it. I don't even understand it. And yet I do  it. Because it is the right thing to do. It is the only good fight there is
The more you code the sooner you become an engineer
No. of projects matters
Meditation = Recharge
We all have to start somewhere
Coding is typing
If you do not quations you will not learn
I do it the dumb way to figure out the same way
Sometimes you need to start the running before you can walk
Postponing will permanently put it in future
It does not have to be perfect.Just do it
I'm a coder because coding is what i do as my passion
Doing it once is not wrong.Doing it again is wrong
Meditate on the problem
Mistakes are the secretrs of success
 Failure is the best thing
